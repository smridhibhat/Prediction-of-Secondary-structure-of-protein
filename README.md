# Prediction-of-Secondary-structure-of-protein
This project applies the concepts of Deep Learning for the scientific problem of predicting the secondary structure of the protein. Multiple approaches for completing this task are explored. These approaches consist of the folllowing methods:
<ol>
  <li>LSTM [Our Approach]</li>
  <li>BiLSTM [Our Approach]</li>
  <li>Deep3I Network (Reduced capacity and parameters applied)[SOTA Approach] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6120586/]</li>
  <li>DeepACLSTM (Reduced capacity and parameters applied) [SOTA Approach] [https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2940-0]</li>
</ol>

The dataset that we used was the CULLPDB dataset, the dataset has been uploaded on this github repository and was originally obtained from https://www.princeton.edu/~jzthree/datasets/ICML2014/
